3.1.0

* Upgraded [afollestad/date-picker](https://github.com/afollestad/date-picker) library to 0.6.1.
* The `updateListItems(...)` method has been split into three variants so that a new listener can be 
passed for plain, single, and multi-choice list dialogs.
* Add `horizontalPadding` boolean parameter to `customView(...)` - when true, 24dp padding is added
to the left and right of your custom view.
